							<h1>Hi There!</h1>
						</header>
						<p>
							My name is Alif and I'm from Bangladesh. I completed my undergrad in CS from IUT and am
							currently an Imaging Science PhD Candidate at RIT. I have strong leadership abilities and a
							vigorous work ethic. I am highly goal-oriented and like to pursue my objectives with a
							laser-sharp focus. While being a highly organized individual, I also love motivating and
							inspiring others toward collaboration. My biggest strength is my ability to adapt and find
							creative ways to work through any obstacle working towards my ambitions. I love playing
							football and basketball. I am obsessed with good movies and TV series.

									<h3>License Plate Recognition Web Application</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									A web application leveraging a flask backend to detect, isolate, and store license
									plates from video. We used Google Vision API for OCR and database for storing best
									results.
									Automatic License Plate Recognition systems aim to provide a solution for detecting,
									localizing, and recognizing license plate characters from vehicles appearing in
									video
									frames. However, deploying such systems in the real world requires real-time
									performance in
									low-resource environments. In our project, we proposed a two-stage detection
									pipeline paired
									with Vision API that provides real-time inference speed along with consistently
									accurate
									detection and recognition performance. We used a haar-cascade classifier as a filter
									on top
									of our backbone MobileNet SSDv2 detection model. This reduces inference time by only
									focusing on high confidence detections and using them for recognition. We also
									imposed a
									temporal frame separation strategy to distinguish between multiple vehicle license
									plates in
									the same clip. We achieved a reasonable detection and recognition performance (82.7%
									detection rate, and 60.8% OCR F1) with real-time processing speed (27 fps).

									<h3>Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Conditional-GAN</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We applied Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (C-GANs) specifically
									tailored for
									Image-to-Image translation, using the Pix2Pix framework. For the generator, we
									implemented a
									sophisticated DoubleU-Net architecture, which is known for its powerful image
									segmentation
									capabilities. To enhance the robustness of our model, we employed a patchGAN as the
									critic.
									This architecture was particularly effective in segmenting skin lesions, a critical
									task in
									medical image analysis. Our novel approach yielded impressive results. We achieved a
									Dice
									Similarity
									Coefficient (DSC) of 89.7%, which is a significant improvement over the performance
									of a
									standalone DoubleU-Net model. The inclusion of the patchGAN critic played a crucial
									role in
									this enhancement, providing adversarial feedback that refined the segmentation
									accuracy.
									This advancement demonstrates the potential of combining Conditional GANs with
									advanced
									network architectures to improve the precision of medical image segmentation tasks.

									<h3>Cat Learns to Jump Buildings Using Q-Learning</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In this project, we used approximate Q-Learning to teach a cat agent the game of
									jumping
									across buildings. We created the game environment and animations from scratch. At
									any given
									state, the actions available to the cat agent are either JUMP or STAY. Depending on
									its
									actions, the cat receives rewards that are stored inside a Q Table. By using the
									classic
									Bellman equations, we implemented an exploration vs exploitation strategy to
									maximize the
									cat's expected utility at each step. After about 1 minute and 30 seconds of playing,
									the cat
									figures out the mechanics of the game and learns to jump just at the right
									time to avoid falling from the buildings. Also during the learning stage,
									we made sure to put a pillow on the ground to ensure a safe landing for the cat. So
									we can
									safely say that no cats were harmed while making this project!

									<h3>Construction and Raw Materials Solutions</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We developed a comprehensive full-stack website utilizing a combination of HTML,
									CSS, and
									Bootstrap for the front-end design, and JavaScript along with jQuery for dynamic
									interactions and client-side scripting. The back-end was powered by Django, a
									high-level
									Python web framework known for its clean design and ease of use. For data
									management, the
									website was seamlessly integrated with an Oracle Database, ensuring robust and
									reliable data
									storage and retrieval.
									The website featured user authentication modules, including login and sign-up
									functionalities, complete with thorough validation processes to ensure data
									integrity and
									security. Additionally, the website included advanced search and filtering
									algorithms,
									enabling users to dynamically search through content and apply various filters to
									refine
									their search results. This combination of technologies and features provided a
									responsive,
									user-friendly, and secure platform.
